# snake_game
a pixel snake game

### a)How to play?
1. use mouse to choose the level you want. When hoover on your desire level, your mouse should turn into hand.
2. click on your chosen level.
3. enter your game.
4. use up/down/left/right on key board to control the snake(green)
5. if snake eats apple(read), snake's length increase one grid
6. the game will stop if the snake crashes on walls.
7. the game records your best scores.

### b)AI tools
1. chatgpt-o4 mini high: generate codes and fix errors
2. sono: generate background music

### c)Prompts worked well:
Things ai already leant, they can generate code very well. For example, I only use one sentence to generate a very basic 
snake game.

### d)Modifications:
After adding sounds, there appeared a control issue: the user cannot properly control the snake. I have to ask gpt to check the 
code again.

### e)Challenges:
 AI needs human to think ahead and guide it. I want to upgrade the image at first. but ai cannot figure the facing of a snake. So I
only add music feature for the game, for the sake of time.

### f)Fun Facts:
made ai song and add it as bg music. 
There was one I like much better, but it is not for free to download.

<mark>LYRICS</mark>

[Verse]
Slither left slide to the right
Twist and turn in the neon light
I’m chasing my tail in a digital maze
Hungry for pixels caught in the craze

[Prechorus]
Don’t hit the wall don’t bite your tail
One wrong move it’s game over fail

[Chorus]
Snake in the grass oh I’m moving fast
Every bite makes me longer can I last
Snake in the grass don’t let me crash
One wrong step and I’m just a flash

[Verse 2]
Grid lines pulse like a heartbeat strong
The rhythm of danger keeps me moving along
An apple ahead glowing like a prize
But every victory comes with a size

[Bridge]
I’m a pixelated serpent in a world of squares
Dodging my mistakes looping everywhere
It’s a simple game but it’s got me hooked
One more try one more look

[Chorus]
Snake in the grass oh I’m moving fast
Every bite makes me longer can I last
Snake in the grass don’t let me crash
One wrong step and I’m just a flash
